**How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?**
So far I feel pretty confident with them. The various methods will take some learning because some require you to include an element in the command, like push, while others dont, like pop.

**Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?**
I would like a better understanding of the array methods and what syntax is needed for which method, as mentioned in question 1, but that will come with time and personal study.

**What questions do you have about Arrays?**
Is there a way to order elements of an array in a certain way. Alphabetically, numerically, so on? Also, is it safe to use irb in the terminal at any point, as in the middle of your work, to test something? Is it a separate "session" if you will from your git work you may be doing?
